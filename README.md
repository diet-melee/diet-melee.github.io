# Diet Melee Website Github repo
This is the repo for the codebase of the Github pages hosted site Diet Melee

### Devs:
If you are trying to add things to the Changelog or the FAQ, download the following template files and rename them of the changelog update you are submitting or just the next unused number (found in the /collections/_faqs folder) in the case of the FAQ (we can reformat it later based on where it should go)

- [changelog-template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diet-melee/diet-melee.github.io/main/example-md/changelog-template.md)
- [faq-template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diet-melee/diet-melee.github.io/main/example-md/faq-template.md)

Once you have created your file and named it in the format **{release_#-#}.md** or **faq{#}.md**, place it into the collections/_changelog or collections/_faqs respectively.  It should automatically be updated after a few minutes when the page gets deployed from Github pages.  If something looks wrong, or you cant figure it out, just let cynthetic know. (She may be the only one making these anyone -\_-)

Some useful links for you to use for writing your changelog stuff:

- [Formatting guide for Markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Semantic versioning guide](https://semver.org/) (for naming your files based on the changelogs version, just read the summary section at the beginning of this document)
