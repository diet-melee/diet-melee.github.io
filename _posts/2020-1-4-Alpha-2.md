title: New Changes in Alpha 2

Another Test of the formatting in Jekyll

- FD has a brand new beautiful model, and of course it’s way more efficient.
- Updated Battlefield ledges to closer reflect how the Battlefield ledges “feel” in vanilla Melee.
- Removed Battlefield’s background to unify the looks of all the stages in the project.
- Updated Stadium to run better and better reflect the design of the project by removing the screen/all background elements.
- Dreamland has removed the branches and leaves, hugely lowering the polygon count on that stage.
- Fountain of Dreams got a fix to its textures.
- The stages that are unplayable are now blocked out on the stage select screen.
