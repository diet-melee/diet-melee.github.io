Q: I got some invalid input error when trying to create the Diet Melee .iso, what do I do?
A: You either dragged the wrong .iso or other file into the folder, or you are tyring to use a .nkit file, which is **NOT** compatable with the patcher. You need to decompress the nkit or download a non-nkit .iso image.
