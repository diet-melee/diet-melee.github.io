Q: XD3_INVALID INPUT What does this mean?

A: Your Melee iso isnâ€™t Vanilla.

Make sure your ISO is valid by right clicking Melee in Dolphin and going to Properties->Info and checking that the revision of Melee is #2.

In the same menu, compute the MD5 hash of the ISO by clicking the Compute button and make sure it matches 0e63d4223b01d9aba596259dc155a174.
