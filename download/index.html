                    <h2>How to install on Windows:</h2>
                    <p>
                        1. Download <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/3o8al3jzltofw7u/diet-melee-patcher_0-7-0.zip/file">Diet Melee Patcher v0.7.0</a> (this is the version for Diet Melee 1.0.1).<br>
                        2. Extract patcher exe and run it.<br>
                        3. Open Dolphin, the one you use for rollback/slippi(and make sure its up to date), and right click your vanilla Melee iso, then click “open containing folder”. See where your vanilla ISO is stored in your computer.<br>
                        4. Once you’ve found your Melee ISO, drag it anywhere on the patcher window.<br>
                        5. It will generate "DietMelee-[version_name]-1-0-1.iso" in the same folder as the patcher if everything went right.<br>
                        6. Put this iso in the same folder as your vanilla Melee iso, and then refresh Dolphin. Diet Melee should show up as a separate ISO, no the vanilla one.<br>
                        You should be good to go. It should be compatible with unranked, direct, and doubles.<br>

Open Dolphin, the one you use for rollback/slippi(and make sure its updated), and right click your vanilla Melee iso, then click “open containing folder”. See where your vanilla ISO is stored in your computer.<br>
                        4. For the first field, find the patch with the extension ".xdelta" in the folder you downloaded it to.<br>
                        5. Second field, put in your vanilla ISO you just found in your Dolphin.<br>
                        6. Third field, browse to the folder your vanilla ISO is in, then put in DietMelee[version_name]-1-0-1.iso (The [version_name] is whichever of the 3 versions you downloaded). Click Save.<br>
                        7. Patch.<br>
